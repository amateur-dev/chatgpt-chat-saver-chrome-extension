# Icon Files

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can create simple colored squares or download appropriate icons.
The icons should represent a PDF or save functionality.

You can create these using any image editor or download free icons from sources like:
- Feather Icons
- Heroicons
- Material Design Icons

Make sure the icons are:
- Transparent background (PNG format)
- Simple and clear design
- Consistent style across all sizes
